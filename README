clutter-sharp offers C#/.NET bindings to Clutter

  Clutter: http://www.clutter-project.com
  Mono:    http://www.mono-project.com

This project is still very young and is not API complete or stable. While
it is currently very useful and usable for complex Clutter usage, there
are still many bugs and APIs to smooth out. If you use clutter-sharp at
this stage, expect future releases to break API and require you to update
your application code.

Applications must copy the system-installed clutter-sharp and bundled
dependencies with their application. The list of files to copy can be
obtained through:

  $ pkg-config --variable=bundlefiles clutter-sharp

clutter-sharp requires Mono 2.4 or better, and gtk-sharp 2.12.1 or better
