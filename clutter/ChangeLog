	Update to clutter 0.4 release
	
	* src/*: update according to new release.
	
	* gapi/clutter-sources.xml:
	* gapi/Makefile.am: re-generate the source files using the full 
	source code.  Only using the headers generates way too little.
	
	* examples/*: rename existing samples and add an entry tester

	* Makefile.am: Recurse into gapi/ only when making a dist, so
	that we don't overwrite the custom code inside src/ on every
	build.

	* gapi/clutter-sources.xml.in:
	* gapi/Makefile.am: Use a template file to get the Clutter
	API from includedir (we should probably use pkg-config, though).

	* *: Initial import of the Clutter-sharp bindings.
